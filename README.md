# TrustCaptcha for TYPO3 — GDPR-compliant, privacy-first CAPTCHA

Protect websites and apps against bots and spam with a privacy-first, EU-hosted CAPTCHA solution.


## What is TrustCaptcha?

TrustCaptcha combines proof-of-work, an AI bot-score and custom security rules to stop automated bot abuse — without image marking or puzzles

Key perks:
- **Privacy-friendly & GDPR-compliant** – data processed exclusively in Europe
- **No visual challenges** – users never label images or solve quizzes
- **Fully themable widget** – matches any brand and design and improves your user flow
- **Conversion-safe** – near-zero user drop-off compared to legacy CAPTCHAs
